- **2)**

Work Recurrence: W(n) = W(n-1) + W(n-2) + c
Work: O(2^n)

- **3)**

Span Recurrence:F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
Span: O(n)

- **4)**

The counts list is a physical integer that is affected by a Fibonnaci sequence. Also the amount of calls is equal to the fibonnaci sequence itself.

- **6)**

The max times fib_top_down(i) will be called is i times. This maximum runtime has a work and span of O(n).

- **8)**

The maximum times Fi is read is equal to i times. The work and span are still O(n).
